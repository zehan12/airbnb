|
|  HELLO ğŸ‘‹! WELCOME TO AIRBNB APP. THIS APP UTILIZES SERVER-SIDE 
|  RENDERING (SSR) AND IS WRITTEN IN RUBY ON RAILS. IT IS BUILT 
|  UPON THE MVC (MODEL-VIEW-CONTROLLER) ARCHITECTURE. THE MODEL 
|  REPRESENTS THE DATA STRUCTURES AND BUSINESS LOGIC, THE VIEW 
|  HANDLES THE DISPLAY OF DATA TO THE USER, AND THE CONTROLLER 
|  RESPONDS TO USER INPUT AND INTERACTS WITH THE MODEL AND VIEW.
|  AIRBNB IS AN ONLINE MARKETPLACE THAT CONNECTS PEOPLE WHO WANT 
|  TO RENT OUT THEIR PROPERTY WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR 
|  ACCOMMODATIONS, TYPICALLY FOR SHORT STAYS. THIS CHATTING APP 
|  ALLOWS YOU TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR CONTACTS IN WEB CHAT ROOMS. 
|  IT ENABLES YOU TO SEND AND RECEIVE MESSAGES. CHATTING APPS MAKE 
|  IT EASIER, SIMPLER, AND FASTER TO CONNECT WITH EVERYONE AND IT 
|  IS ALSO EASY TO USE, FEEL FREE TO REACH OUT TO ME OR OPEN 
|  AN ISSUE ON GITHUB. THANKS!
